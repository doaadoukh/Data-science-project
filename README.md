# Data-science-project
2nd year computer science final assessment for a data science module

We were given a brief and unnormalised data about a UK bank's financial data, where we had to analyse the data in order to help them improve their financial services and present them to the stakeholders of the bank. These findings are to help improve customer service and inform data-driven decision making within the organisation. 

This project gave me insight into the business and financial sector as well as how to analyse data and extract key points which would be useful for a bank to be aware of in order to help its customers. 

I had to come up with 5 modelling solutions based on things we learnt throughout the module and analyse, discuss and present our findings to the key stakeholders of the bank.
